Here you can find a list of some of my personal software projects. This list is probably woefully incomplete. At any given time I have several projects going on and I only occasionally get around to updating this page.

# [Intel 8080 Disassembler](https://github.com/serialphotog/8080disassembler)

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/software/Intel8080DisassemblerOutput-1.png)

A very simple disassembler for the Intel 8080 microprocessor, written in C. I wrote a blog post detailing the basics of how this project works [here]({% post_url 2018-12-03-Simple-Disassembler-For-Intel-8080-Microprocessor %}).

# [MTiler](https://github.com/serialphotog/mTiler)

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/software/AppScreenshot.png)

mTiler is a utility for Microsoft Windows that merges incomplete map tiles into complete tiles.

# [GPX2CSV](https://github.com/serialphotog/gpx2csv)

This is a simple command line utility that converts waypoints in a GPX file into a CSV file of waypoints. This was developed to allow me to view some of my personal landforms databases in a spreadsheet.

# [MBExport](https://github.com/serialphotog/mbexport)

MBExport is a small, simple command-line utility that dumps map tiles from an MBTiles database.

# [NOAA Animator](https://github.com/serialphotog/NOAA-Animator)

This is a simple PHP application that downloads weather radar images from <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NOAA</a> and converts them into animated GIFs.
