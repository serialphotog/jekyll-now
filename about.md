Hello, and welcome to my little, geeky corner of the web! Online, I’m probably better known as <a href="https://serialphotog.com" target="_blank">The Serial Photog</a>, but my photography is just one aspect of my life. I’m also a technical guy that loves nothing more than hacking on all sorts of software projects. With this blog, I intend to share not only project logs, but also high-quality articles aimed at teaching you the concepts of everything from computer science to software development (and plenty more in-between).
